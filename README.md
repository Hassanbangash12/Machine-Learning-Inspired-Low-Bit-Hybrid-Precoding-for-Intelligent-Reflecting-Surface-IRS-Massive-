# Machine-Learning-Inspired-Low-Bit-Hybrid-Precoding-for-Intelligent-Reflecting-Surface-IRS-Massive-

The number of bits required in phase shifters (PS) in hybrid precoding (HP) has a significant impact on sum-rate, spectral efficiency (SE),
and energy efficiency (EE). The space and cost constraints of a realistic massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system limit the number
of antennas at the base station (BS), limiting the throughput gain promised by theoretical analysis. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of 
employing an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance performance while reducing costs and power efficiency. In particular, an IRS is made 
up of a huge number of reflecting elements, each of which has a phase shift that can be adjustable. By jointly optimizing the source precoder at 
BS and selecting the optimal phase-shift matrix values at IRS, we can alter the direction of signal propagation by modifying all IRS phase shifts
and then selecting the ideal phase-shift values. Additionally, we can improve sum-rate, EE, and SE performance. Furthermore, we proposed an energy-efficient
HP at BS in which the analog component is implemented using a low-resolution PS rather than a high-resolution PS. Our analysis reveals that the performance 
gets better as the number of bits increases. We formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the source precoder at BS and the reflection coefficient at IRS 
to improve the system performance, However, because of non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem. Motivated by cross-entropy (CE) 
optimization developed in machine learning, we further suggested an adaptive cross-entropy (ACE) 1-3 bit PS-based optimization HP strategy for this novel 
architecture. The increase in bits can significantly decrease the power consumption, yielding an increase in the performance parameters (SE, EE, and sum-rate). 
The simulation results are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, which highlights the IRS efficiency gains to boost sum-rate, SE, and EE compared to
previously reported methods.
